## Introduction
The Decentralized Token Exchange is a client-side application that enables users to exchange tokens in a decentralized manner. It leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate secure and transparent token swaps.

This project provides an intuitive user interface where users can connect their wallets, view token balances, place buy and sell orders, track order books, view trade history, and manage their transactions on the decentralized exchange.

## Features
- **Token Exchange**: Users can seamlessly exchange tokens using the decentralized exchange.
- **Wallet Integration**: Integration with wallets like Metamask allows users to connect their accounts and manage their token balances.
- **Order Placement**: Users can place buy and sell orders for different token pairs.
- **Order Book**: The application displays the order book, allowing users to view current buy and sell orders.
- **Trade History**: Users can track their trade history to monitor executed transactions.
- **Account Management**: The application enables users to manage their accounts, view balances, and track transaction status.
